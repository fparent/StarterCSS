StarterCSS is a nifty resource to help you start your Web sites and application on the right foot.

Technically, it combines normalize.css (by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal), many of the best practices, and some base modular styles for your pleasure. The result is a progressive, flexible, consistent across browsers, lightweight (~10Kb), production-ready CSS. 

StarterCSS also reset/emulates some of the original styles of different browsers, which proved to be a rewarding science. 

It might be helpful to you?
* Corrects inconsistencies and provide useful basic styles
* Preserves useful defaults (as per normalize.css) while reseting only some of the elements
* Basic support for new HTML5 elements
* Uses a modular structure: it's easy for you to remove unwanted sections of styling
* Goes beyond just resetting; it adds beautiful and handy styles for certain elements
* Make your project look beautiful on any size, any devices (mobile, tablet, Web)

Remember that this is still a work in progress. As browsers and web development techniques keep evolving, so will this framework. I trully encourage you to go ahead and play with starter.css; this a only a starting point. Add, remove, edit rulesets or styles to make it perfect for your needs. When it comes to CSS framework, there's no "one size fit all" solution!
